# ML-SIG-2019
This is the official repository for BITS-ACM ML summer SIG - 2019  
> **UPDATE**
for an interactive and succint introduction to Machine Learning, check out our [introductory lecture](https://github.com/MananSoni42/ML_SIG_2019_Lecture).

## Contents
The summer course is broadly divided into 3 modules:  

### Module 1: Python and Numpy
- This module teaches you the basics of the Python programming language along with a few other useful tools
- After completion you should be able to:
    - Know how to write simple programs in ```Python```
    - Know the basics of ```git``` and ```Jupyter notebooks```
    - Learn how to write optimized code using the ```numpy``` library.
- To complete: finish ```task-01-numpy/numpy_tasks.ipynb```
- For more details: refer to the task [readme](task-01-numpy/README.md), the [task pdf](task-01-numpy/task1.pdf).

### Module 2: Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks
- In this module you will learn about Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks and everything in between!
- After completion you should be able to:
    - Implement your own Genetic Algorithms
    - Understand the basic working of Neural networks
    - Implement a simple feedforward network
- To complete: finish ```task-02-GA-NN/GA_task.ipynb``` and ```neural_net.py```
- For more details: refer to the task [readme](task-02-GA-NN/README.md), the [task instructions](task-02-GA-NN/instructions.pdf) and the provided [resources](task-02-GA-NN/resources).

### Module 3: Racing cars
- Enough theory. In this module, we will build intelligent cars and race them against each others!
- After completion you should be able to:
    - Learn how to use Genetic algorithms and Neural networks in practice
    - Get a taste of how models are trained and tested
    - Design cars which can efficiently maneuver any given track
- To complete: Submit your own car (preferably as a Jupyter notebook)
- For more details: refer to the task [readme](task-03-racing-game/README.md) and the 2 given examples: [simple example](task-03-racing-game/example_simple.py) and [ML-GA example](task-03-racing-game/example_ml.py)
> PS: If we get enough submissions, we will organize a community race and display the results on #ML-SIG
