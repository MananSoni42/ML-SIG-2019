# Racing cars 
For your final task, you have to program a car which can maneuver a given track! 
How? 
You will be given 12 parameters: 
* Distance of the car from the current track [img reqd]
* It's velocity  

And you are asked to predict it's acceleration for each iteration.

### Instructions
* Install the required dependcies by runnning:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Carefully go through the 2 example codes given to understand how to use the given APIs
* To create a new track: Draw a picture of your track (try: pinta) and run:
    `python get_track.py path/to/image path/to/result_file`
* `car.py` implements a class Car. It takes 2 arguements - the track path and the acceleration function
### Submission
* It is recommended that you create a Jupyter notebook for your final submission
* You should also save your final ML model and it's weights seperately

### Objectives
* Design cars which can efficiently maneuver any given track
* maximize the distance travelled by the car
* Minimize the time taken to reach the finish line
* And any other objective that you find interesting! (like ensurung that the car moves smoothly)

### Important 
* It is recommended that you use a Machine Learning based solution, but this is not necessary, you can be as creative as you want.
* If you find any bugs or feel that a feature is missing, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request on github.
